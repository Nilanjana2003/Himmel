# 🌌 Himmel - Exoplanet Habitability Predictor
An exoplanet habitability predictor using logistic regression. Remember, this is super simple, just a trial to check how logistic regression might work.


Himmel is a simple yet educational project that predicts the potential habitability of exoplanets using **logistic regression**. Designed as a beginner-friendly exploration into machine learning, Himmel uses real-world features to classify whether a planet may be habitable.



## 🔍 Project Overview

This project was created to:
- Demonstrate the working of logistic regression.
- Explore feature relationships with basic visualizations.
- Experiment with binary classification in an astrophysical context.




## ⚙️ Features

- Binary classification using logistic regression
- Custom dataset preprocessing
- Visualization of feature relationships



## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository** or download the files.
2. Ensure Python 3 and the following libraries are installed:
   - `numpy`
   - `matplotlib`
   - `pandas`
   - `sklearn`
3. Run the scripts.
4. ## 📊 Output

* Console output includes accuracy and classification results.
* `graph.py` provides graphical plots to help understand feature distribution and correlation.


5.## 📚 Notes

* This is a **very simple prototype**, not intended for scientific conclusions.
* Ideal for beginners to understand ML concepts in a fun context.
